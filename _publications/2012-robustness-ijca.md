abstract: >
  Real-time systems operate in unpredictable, changing environments that can degrade performance. This paper evaluates the robustness of resource allocation under Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling on uniprocessor systems, using makespan as the performance metric. It defines deterministic and stochastic robustness metrics, introduces the FePIA procedure and experiments showing EDF’s robustness scales with task volume, and compares EDF vs. RM scheduling under varying loads.
