abstract: >
  SealQA introduces a challenging benchmark for evaluating search‑augmented language models on fact‑seeking questions, confronting noisy, conflicting, or misleading web search results. It includes three variants—Seal‑0 (core set), Seal‑Hard, and LongSeal (multi‑document with distractors)—and reveals major performance gaps: current frontier LLMs, even with search tools, achieve only ~17% accuracy on Seal‑0, show no consistent gains from more compute, and struggle with document retrieval in LongSeal. The dataset is publicly released to encourage progress in robust, retrieval‑augmented reasoning.
