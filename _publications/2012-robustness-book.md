abstract: >
  Real-time distributed systems (RTDS) face unpredictable changes such as machine failures,
  load spikes, or estimation errors, which can degrade performance. This book presents algorithms
  and techniques for robust resource allocation under such uncertainties, ensuring stability
  and controlled degradation of performance metrics like schedule length, load balance, and queue
  waiting time by accounting for estimation variability in resource demands.
