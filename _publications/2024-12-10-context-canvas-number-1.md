  We introduce a novel approach to enhance the capabilities of text-to-image models by incorporating a graph-based RAG. Our system dynamically retrieves detailed character information and relational data from the knowledge graph, enabling the generation of visually accurate and contextually rich images. This capability significantly improves upon the limitations of existing T2I models, which often struggle with the accurate depiction of complex or culturally specific subjects due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-correcting mechanism for text-to-image models to ensure consistency and fidelity in visual outputs, leveraging the rich context from the graph to guide corrections. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that Context Canvas significantly enhances the capabilities of popular models such as Flux, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E, and improves the functionality of ControlNet for fine-grained image editing tasks. To our knowledge, Context Canvas represents the first application of graph-based RAG in enhancing T2I models, representing a significant advancement for producing high-fidelity, context-aware multi-faceted images.
