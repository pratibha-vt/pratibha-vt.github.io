  —This paper addresses the challenge of transforming complex sentences into sequences of logical, simplified sentences while preserving semantic and logical integrity with the help of Large Language Models. We propose a hybrid approach that combines advanced prompting with multi-agent architectures to enhance the sentence simplification process. Experimental results show that our approach was able to successfully simplify 70% of the complex sentences written for video game design application. In comparison, a single-agent approach attained a 48% success rate on the same task.{index=1}.
