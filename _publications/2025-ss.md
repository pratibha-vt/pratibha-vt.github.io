  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques enhance large language models (LLMs) by supplementing prompts with relevant external documents. This paper explores RAGâ€™s effectiveness in source code summarization using a real-world dataset of code-comment pairs. The study introduces an evaluation framework comparing different retrieval techniques and documents of varying granularity, including file-level and function-level code snippets, and leverages BM25 and dense retrievers. Results show that function-level documents retrieved using dense retrievers significantly improve summarization performance. The paper also discusses challenges such as context overlap and computational cost in code retrieval-based generation.
